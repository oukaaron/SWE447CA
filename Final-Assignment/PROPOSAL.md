1) 
For my project, I will be making taking the concept of the Solar System assignment and revamping it. I will be rendering the Earthâ€™s solar system which includes all nine planets, the Sun, the moon, and some other planetary moons. Each planet will be textured map and the planets will orbit the Sun proportional to their planetary years.

2)
Week1: Collet information for each planet and find/create a model of a sphere.

Week2: Complete code necessary to render sphere and apply appropriate texture map.

Week3: Position and scale each planet relative to the Sun. (Planets will not have animated orbits at this stage).

Week4: Add motion for the planets. (I.E. planetary spin, orbit around the sun). Some moons should be orbiting the planets at this stage.

Week5 (Stretch goal): Add a star field via random positioning shades of gray on the solar system.

3)
I will be using THREE.js
